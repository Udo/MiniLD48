Okay, what are we going to do... facade, scheme, conspiracy, deceit!

I know: scheming wizards! A social simulation where you are playing the bad guy who has to keep the lid on the conspiracy!

You're an evil professor at Dorkwads, the school for pretentious little wizards. Your mission is to conjure the dark gods
and to keep those meddling kids from figuring out what you're up to.

Things we need:
- school map
  - students and staff going about their business
  - ...
  - profit!
